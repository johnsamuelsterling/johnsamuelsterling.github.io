Here is my n=1 perspective on applying for a PhD in computer science at a research University. I think a PhD is awesome. It allows you to grow into a world-class researcher, push the boundaries of human knowledge, and connect with an international research community.

If you want to do a PhD with me---awesome---please apply to the <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction Institute">HCII</abbr> at <abbr title="Carnegie Mellon University">CMU</abbr>. I am looking forward to your application especially if you are from a non-traditional background! If you are curious about some general background on a PhD, read [this comprehensive summary](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf). If you email me about your application, note that I [may be unable to respond](https://talkingtorobots.com/FAQ.html).
